    <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items for your Website Assesment</b></h1>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements.  Do not name this page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Please, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
      <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it</li>
      <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
    delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
    mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
    differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
    better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
    look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
    might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
    it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
    it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
    style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
    assignment tasks.</li>
      <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
      <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><b>Website Topic</b></h1>
    <p>Hi! My name is Qianwen Shen, you can call me Sylvia. I'm from China, and I'm currently studying for a master's degree in computing at Anu. Regarding the web topic requested by this assignment, I would like to introduce myself and some of my hobbies.
      The first thing I want to introduce is my photography hobby. I love photography. When I have free time, I will pick up my camera and go shooting on the streets to record some interesting moments. Every time I see these photos of scenery and portraits, it reminds me of some unique memories. When I travel to other places, I will also use my camera to record some of the customs of other places. So I will put some photos I took on this web page and attach some stories related to these photos. In addition, I will also post some videos I edited on this website.
      I'm also a big movie buff and I'd love to share a 'My Top Movie Picks' section. I'll list some of my favourites and pick two or three standout movies from different categories, like science fiction, thrillers, historical dramas, romances, etc. For each movie, I'll include a few film screenshots and some of the most memorable lines.
      In addition, I prefer crystal bracelets, so I can also share some about these different crystals and the energy of these crystals on this website. And I also made a lot of crystal bracelets for my good friends, so I can also share some related stories and photos.
      </p> 
    <p>Note: You will not be able to change this topic in the future.</p>
